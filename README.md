#translator-apsim#

This translator for APSIM reads from AgMIP standard json file, converts it to a set of POJOs, and serializes to APSIM files using Velocity. 

It has been developed in Gainesville, FL, during the 2nd AgMIP Development Sprint, by Dean Holzworth and Ioannis N. Athanasiadis.

The translator has been updated to read APSIM XML files and convert them into the AgMIP common format. Currently reads only weather and soil information. Updated in Austin, TX, during the 4th AgMIP Development Sprint, by Dean Holzworth and Ioannis N. Athanasiadis.
